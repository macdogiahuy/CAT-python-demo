Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects" which are data structures that contain data, in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures.

Encapsulation is the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data.

Inheritance is the mechanism in OOP by which one class can inherit properties and behavior from another class.

Polymorphism is the ability of different objects to respond, each in its own way, to identical messages (method calls).

An interface in Java is an abstract type used to specify a behavior that classes must implement.

A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects when they are created.

The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) executes Java bytecode and provides a runtime environment.

The `final` keyword in Java prevents a variable from being modified after it has been initialized.

A stack data structure follows Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.

A queue data structure follows First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.

Static methods belong to the class rather than any instance of the class.

A checked exception in Java must be either caught or declared in the method signature using the `throws` keyword.

Garbage collection in Java automatically reclaims memory occupied by objects that are no longer reachable.

Thread safety means that code functions correctly when accessed from multiple threads concurrently.

The `synchronized` keyword in Java is used to control access to a method or block by multiple threads.
